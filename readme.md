# ðŸ”¥ Create Ignite Kit

`create-ignite-kit` is a powerful, interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to bootstrap production-ready React applications in seconds. It goes beyond basic templates by setting up a robust, scalable architecture with your choice of configurations, allowing you to start developing features immediately.

This tool is built upon a production-grade template that already includes:
- Vite for lightning-fast tooling
- Git, Husky, commitlint, and lint-staged for a professional Git workflow
- ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint for code quality and consistency
- Screaming Architecture for project structure
- Absolute Paths for clean imports
- Unit Testing with Vitest
- CI/CD Pipeline setup with GitHub Actions
- Structured Error Handling with Sentry

## ðŸš€ Installation

To use `create-ignite-kit`, install it globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g create-ignite-kit
```

## Usage

Creating a new project is as simple as running one command:

```bash
create-ignite-kit create <your-project-name>
```

The CLI will then guide you through a series of questions to tailor the project to your specific needs.

### Current Options

You will be prompted to select your preferred tools for:

1.  **State Management:**
    - `Redux Toolkit`
    - `Zustand`
    - `None`

2.  **UI Library:**
    - `Material UI`
    - `Tailwind CSS`
    - `None`

3.  **Data Fetching:**
    - **TanStack Query (React Query):** Choose whether to include this powerful library for server-state management. _(Implemented)_

4.  **Containerization:**
    - **Docker:** Choose whether to add a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for easy containerization and deployment. _(Implemented)_

## âœ¨ Features

### Production-Ready Foundation
Your new project isn't just a "hello world" app. It's a fully configured development environment.

### Interactive Setup
No need to manually edit config files. The interactive prompts let you choose the stack you want, and the CLI handles the rest.

### Automated Integration
The tool doesn't just install packages. It actively modifies the source code to integrate them correctly. For example:
- **React Query:** Automatically wraps your `<App />` component with the `QueryClientProvider`.
- **Docker:** Adds a ready-to-use `Dockerfile` for building production images.
